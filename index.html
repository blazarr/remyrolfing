              you can use an HSA or FSA for anything health-related. I handle my own paperwork, and lack the time to wrestle
              with an insurance company.

        <!-- What to Expect
        –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– -->

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>Rolfing is done on a bodywork table, but there is more client movement than during a massage. Clients typically shift
          positions several times in a session to allow better contact to the area being worked. Sheets for draping, blankets
          for temperature control, and pillows for comfort in varying positions will be available.</p>

        <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
        <p>
          Underwear is typically worn during the session. For guys this means wearing some form of briefs. For ladies this means wearing
          briefs and preferably a standard bra (sports bras, cross straps, and strapless tend to cause patterns of holding
          we want to avoid during the work.). As always the client's comfort level is very important to me, and atypical/non
          binary gendered persons should feel free to speak to me directly about any concerns or questions regarding attire.
        </p>

        <h3>How often should I receive sessions?</h3>
        <p>
          As often as once a week, but time lapsed between sessions should not exceed one month. The work takes time to integrate properly, and often it best serves
          the client to have time between sessions to move around in their body as changes in patterns develop.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I have to commit to ten sessions?</h3>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight:700;">No</span>, you will experience the benefits after your first session.
          </br>
          </br>
          Rolfing is a process, and as such takes time to integrate. The 10 series works, and it is able to achieve fabulous results
          because the entire organism is considered through the process. Each session has short term benefits that include
          pain reduction, increased mobility, more balance, etc. but it is when the series is done in proper succession that
          these benefits stack and amplify one another.
        </p>

        <h3>Does it hurt?</h3>
        <p>
          Rolfing gained notoriety for being painful in its early days, but has developed substantially with new scientific and medical
          knowledge. As such the work no longer brings the client into a pain experience, but we work efficiently within
          the bounds of the individual's comfort level. I believe it's possible to be both painless, and effective.

          <h2>What is Rolfing®?</h2>
          <p>Named after its founder, Dr. Ida P. Rolf, Rolfing Structural Integration is a form of bodywork that reorganizes
            the structure of the body through manipulation of the soft tissue. We so reorganize the body through comprehensive
            manual therapy, client movement reeducation, and the 10 series formula given to us by its designer, Dr. Rolf.
            Research has demonstrated that Rolfing results in more efficient muscle use, allows the body to conserve energy,
            and creates more refined patterns of movement. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <h2>What Rolfing® Isn't</h2>
          <p> Rolfing is not massage therapy, chiropractic, physical therapy, acupuncture/pressure, or bodyworker technique.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <h2>What are the origins of Rolfing®?</h2>
          <p>Rolfing Structural Integration is the life's work of Dr. Ida P. Rolf, and was refined over the course of 40 years
            before the institute was created. Dr. Rolf received a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Columbia University in 1920,
            and continued to expand her knowledge through her work in organic chemistry at the Rockefeller Institute.</p>
          <p>Dr. Rolf was perpetually seeking ways to alleviate the physical maladies for herself and her family which brought
            her to study chiropractic, osteopathy, yoga, and the human potential movement. Fusing all of her knowledge together,
            she began practicing on clients and refined the 10 series over time to use as both a method of treatment and
            eventually a teaching tool.</p>
