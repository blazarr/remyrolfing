        <h2>About Remy</h2>
        <p>
            Remy grew up in the Ellicott City area working at their parent's business until moving around in search of a profession that felt right.
            Eventually Remy learned they had an aptitude for touch, and began researching massage therapy in 2008. 
            Remy fell in love with the rewarding and often peaceful work of manual therapy, and began a fulfilling career. 
            Through the course of their work, Remy found that the most rewarding experience for them was in corrective therapies focused on healing a malady.
            This led Remy to seek more knowledge and skill in Boulder Colorado at the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon graduating, Remy had a new focus, to bring the wonderful work they learned back home to heal their own community. 
            Remy loves working with teachers, gamers, folks from every stripe of healthcare profession, and fellow human travelers of all varieties. 
            Remy is a strong ally and friend of the LGBTQIA+ community, and does not tolerate hate speech targeted at ANY person. 
            They strongly believe that courtesy is free, and a genuine smile can make a difference.
